It is a basic introduction to tensorflow, the jupyter file provide some understanding for the lecture1-3 of mine.  
So it is a simple and basic tutorial for the tf beginners.  
If you want to deep into tensorflow for some practical experienmentï¼Œyou can learn by yourself for following lectures which I never take.  
Hope this can provide a little help for people new to tf.  
By the way, I am also a tensorflow beginner. There are something wrong taking place is not suprising, hope you can correct me.
